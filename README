Morse encoder and decoder.

Usage:

    morse < text.txt > morse.txt
    morse -r < morse.txt > text.txt

This was made so that I could read Caliope's messages in the Homestuck webcomic
when she communicates with Roxy through Morse code:

A personal challenge was to encode each Morse code with only 8 bits. I did this
by encoding dots as set bits and dashes as unset bits, and indicated the length
of the code by a terminating set bit followed by zeros - ie. the length of the
code is the index of the last set bit. This leaves room for a maximum of 7 dots
and dashes.
